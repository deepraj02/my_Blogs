## Top 10 Vs Code  Extentions (sept. 2022)

## Almost all of us can agree that VS CODE is one of the best Code-Editor if not the BEST.
Let's make this VS CODE experience better with adding some amazing Extensions which I use in my day to day work and most of these extensions can be used by developers of all languages.

# 1. [GitLens â€” Git supercharged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

GitLens is an open-source extension for Visual Studio Code.
GitLens simply helps you better understand code. Quickly glimpse into whom, why, and when a line or code block was changed. Jump back through history to gain further insights as to how and why the code evolved. Effortlessly explore the history and evolution of a codebase.

GitLens is powerful, feature rich, and highly customizable to meet your needs. Do you find CodeLens intrusive or the current line blame annotation distracting â€” no problem, quickly turn them off or change how they behave via the interactive GitLens Settings editor. For advanced customizations, refer to the GitLens docs and edit your user settings.
