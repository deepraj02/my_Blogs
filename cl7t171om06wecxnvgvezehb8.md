## Video Resources (PaidüöÄ):

There are many paid Flutter Resources on the Internet, but personally I feel that most of them are outdated and following them is not recommended

But the only paid course which I find to be updated and Properly Structured is

- [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2022 Edition]](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.
  > This Course covers all aspects of the Flutter Framework , contains interactive quizes after every module to test your understanding, have a awesome Discord Community where you can ask for help or solve problems of other community members as well and is Constantly Updated which makes it Unique.


Although not a definitive list of every resource out there, I found these resources to be the best in helping me gain a deeper understanding of Flutter and allowed me to quickly ramp up on the technology. I hope they will help you as much as they helped me. Comment and let me know if there are any other resources that you have used or are using when learning Flutter and Dart. I‚Äôm always on the lookout for anything to help me better understand the language and framework.
